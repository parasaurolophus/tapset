The _tapset_ app is compiled using three [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) projects, one for the main executable and two libraries. The [nfc](nfcLibrary.md) library contains abstract classes that are useful for any app that reads and writes the contents of NFC tags, while the [fileprovider](fileproviderLibrary.md) library contains a simple, general-purpose [ContentProvider](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider.html) for sharing files with other apps while avoiding the deprecated [MODE\_WORLD\_READABLE](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#MODE_WORLD_READABLE) approach.

This project also relies on two pre-compiled binary libraries for which no source is given here, because they contain third-party, open-source code. They both come from the [zxing](https://code.google.com/p/zxing/) project. One is the output of building their open-source QR encoding/decoding library, while the other contains two classes described by them in their [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/zxing/wiki/ScanningViaIntent). Together, these libraries are used to support sharing settings data as QR codes with other apps and requesting the services of the `zxing` [Barcode Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android) app to obtain settings data by scanning such QR codes. This "interoperation through [Intent](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html)" is a key Android programming concept illustrated by both this project and the `zxing` project.
